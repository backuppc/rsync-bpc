NEWS for rsync-bpc-3.0.9.

3.0.9.11 released 13 Dec 2017:

    - ensure hlink_nlinks is non-NULL before using it.

3.0.9.10 released 5 Dec 2017:

    - only call hard_link_bpc_update_link_count() if preserve_hard_links; patch from @ovidiustanila.

3.0.9.9 released 3 Dec 2017:

    - during cleanup, generator now checks the backuppc inode hardlink counts to make sure they match
      the number of identical hardlinks transferred.

    - updated backuppc library to capture changes in backup-xs (no effect on rsync-bpc).

3.0.9.8 released 11 Jun 2017:

    - fixed version number in configure.ac and configure.sh, which was incorrectly left at 3.0.9.6
      in the 3.0.9.7 release.

3.0.9.7 released 25 May 2017:

    - fixed reference counting bug in bpc_unlink()

    - fixed memory leak on file open fail in backuppc/bpc_fileZIO.c, and minor leak in backuppc/bpc_dirOps.c

3.0.9.6 released 23 Mar 2017:

    - updates to bpc_attribCache to sanitize path names and prepending ac->currentDir
      in bpc_attribCache_getDirEntries().  Fixes certain restore cases.

3.0.9.5 released 3 Mar 2017:

    - Reference counting is now per-backup; replaced static delta information with callable interface.

    - Attribute files are now zero-length with the md5 digest encoded in the file name.

3.0.9.4 released 18 Jun 2016:

    - changes to backuppc/bpc_hashTable so that resizing doesn't move the entries. The nodes are stored as
      pointers (rather than flat); a freelist maintains unused nodes.

3.0.9.3 released 1 Dec 2013:

    - Fixed bug in merging of V3 incrementals during restore.  Reported by
      Denis Jedig and Steve Palm.

3.0.9.2 released 16 Sep 2013:

NEWS for rsync 3.0.9 (23 Sep 2011)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.8:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fix a crash bug in checksum scanning when --inplace is used.

    - Fix a hang if a hard-linked file cannot be opened by the sender (e.g.
      if it has no read permission).

    - Fix preservation of a symlink's system xattrs (e.g. selinux) on Linux.

    - Fix a memory leak in the xattr code.

    - Fixed a bug with --delete-excluded when a filter merge file has a rule
      that specifies a receiver-only side restriction.

    - Fix a bug with the modifying of unwritable directories.

    - Fix --fake-super's interaction with --link-dest same-file comparisons.

    - Fix the updating of the curr_dir buffer to avoid a duplicate slash.

    - Fix the directory permissions on an implied dot-dir when using --relative
      (e.g. /outside/path/././send/path).

    - Fixed some too-long sleeping instances when using --bwlimit.

    - Fixed when symlink ownership difference-checking gets compiled into
      unchanged_attrs().

    - Improved the socket-error reporting when multiple protocols fail.

    - Fixed a case where a socket error could reference just-freed memory.

    - Failing to use a password file that was specified on the command-line is
      now a fatal error.

    - Fix the non-root updating of directories that don't have the read and/or
      execute permission.

    - Make daemon-excluded file errors more error-like.

    - Fix a compilation issue on older C compilers (due to a misplaced var
      declaration).

    - Make configure avoid finding socketpair on cygwin.

    - Avoid trying to reference SO_BROADCAST if the OS doesn't support it.

    - Fix some issues with the post-processing of the man pages.

    - Fixed the user home-dir handling in the support/lsh script.

    - Some minor manpage improvements.
